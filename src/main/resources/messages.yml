HelpTextFill: "This command will generate missing world chunks inside your border. [freq] is the frequency of chunks per second that will be checked (default 20). [pad] is the number of blocks padding added beyond the border itself (default 208, to cover player visual range). [force] can be specified as true to force all chunks to be loaded even if they seem to be fully generated (default false)."
HelpTextOther: "Default value: 5. The <amount> is in server ticks, of which there are roughly 20 every second, each tick taking ~50ms. The default value therefore has border checks run about 4 times per second."
